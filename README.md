# Notes
Javascript wwas created by Brendan Ike in the year 1995
It was created in 10 days
It was originally named Moca in development
It was created under the supervision of Netscape and Sun Microsystems
Its production name was Livescript
It was renamed as a joke to Sun Microsystems as a joke
it has no relationship with the Java programming language
Microsoft reversed engineered livescript and called it Jscript as they could not use livescript and javascript as they were trademarked
There was a need for just one standard 
The European Computer Manufacturers Association then set a standard hence the name ECMAScript
Javascript comes with a JIT compiler 
JIT mean just in time
Javascript is a loosely typed language meaning it change datatype

# API
API stands for application programming interface
Api is just a collection of functions and properties 
Api can be inside another API and this sub API is called Embedded API or Extended API or Extension Api
When 
When you create a new object, you have created an API

# Primitive Data
Primitive Data means basic data
"String" is an example of a primitive data
backticks (\) can be used to escape special characters
"Numbers" is an example of a primitive data
there are two types of numbers
whole integers and floating point numbers
"Boolean" is an example of a primitive data
there are two types rather states of booleans - true or false
"null" and "undefined" are primitive data
"NaN" is a primitive data
NaN means Not a number.

# Operators
Programming Languages will not exist without operators
An operator is a predefined function in a compiler
An operator is a subroutine i.e its predefined
Operators are executed in memory and ran directly by compilers
There are precedence to operators
Precedence for operators in javascript can be checked at MDN
