# Notes
Javascript wwas created by Brendan Ike in the year 1995
It was created in 10 days
It was originally named Moca in development
It was created under the supervision of Netscape and Sun Microsystems
Its production name was Livescript
It was renamed as a joke to Sun Microsystems as a joke
it has no relationship with the Java programming language
Microsoft reversed engineered livescript and called it Jscript as they could not use livescript and javascript as they were trademarked
There was a need for just one standard 
The European Computer Manufacturers Association then set a standard hence the name ECMAScript
